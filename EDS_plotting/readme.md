This code allows one to plot EDX maps and spectra, including cumulative ones, for the series of measurements.

Selection of elements, lines, colors, normalizations, etc is manual and hardcoded for the moment; better approach is to be implemented.

NB! The mapping-related code implies square pixels!

Known issues and TODO:

 - scalebar implementation is needed
 - code cleanup is required
 - specific folders structure is hardcoded, but can be more flexible
 - more comments needed
 - generalized approach for different lines energy
